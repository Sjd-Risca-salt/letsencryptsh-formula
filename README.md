# letsencrypt.sh-formula
Saltstack formula for letsencrypt, using the client letsencrypt.sh

## Why

The official client is quite complex for the task required, what if using just a bunch of bash scripts? 
By now this fomula supports by default only nginx, but I hope to get also apache support soon.
